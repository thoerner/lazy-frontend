            <h2>The Lazy Butts Story</h2>
            <p>As the 3D Kings, we know each lion in our pride is a glorious individualâ€”majestic from the tip of their mane to the, well, let's say, unique characteristics of their backside. It dawned on us that something was missing from our NFT pride: the other "half" of our lionhood. Enter Lazy Butts NFTs, the yin to our mane's yang, the behind-the-scenes star that deserved its own spotlight.</p>
            <p>We wanted to broaden the scope of our majestic aura by honoring our lion-ness in its entirety. Lazy Butts NFT is our whimsical yet considered response to the partial portrayal of our regal Lazy Lions. In the same vein as the original Lazy Lions, Lazy Butts offers a dash of humor, light-heartedness, and of course, more individuality to the blockchain world. It's our endeavor to create a fuller, richer, and funnier NFT experience for all.</p>
