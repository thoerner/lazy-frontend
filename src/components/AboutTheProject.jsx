            <h1>A Message From The Team</h1>
            <h2>Embrace the Full ROAR of Your Lion with <span style={{ fontSize: 'larger' }}>Lazy Butts</span>!</h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '50px', margin: '0' }}>ü¶Å üçë</p>
            <p>As the 3D Kings, we're always looking out for our Pride. We saw an opportunity to help you express your lion even more boldly, extending its splendor and ROAR! Our vision? To provide a new dimension of expression and opportunity for our community members to enhance their unique IP.</p>
            <p>Blessed with a troupe of incredibly talented individuals in our Pride, we devised a plan to offer a low-cost claim for all lion holders, all while supporting the growth of the 3D Kings community. A significant portion of the funds raised through Lazy Butts will go directly to the 3D Kings Community Wallet, further fueling our collective efforts.</p>
            <p>Everyone who had a paw in crafting the Lazy Butts project is a proud owner of a 3D Lazy NFT. It's worth noting, however, that while we all are a part of the Lazy Lions community, Lazy Butts is not officially affiliated with the Lazy Lions project.</p>
            <p>Lazy Butts is an independent venture, created by lions, for lions. A delightful, full-bodied expression of our love for our Lazy Lions, and a testament to the creativity, fun, and camaraderie within our Pride. Embrace the ROAR, adopt a Lazy Butt today!</p>
